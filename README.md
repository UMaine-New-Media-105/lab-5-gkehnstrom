in Lab5 today we replaced sprites with our sprites and then used code to make it possible to move the sprite up and down as wee were told to do, also
we were tasked to make our sprite go random everywhere on the canvas with staying inside of the borders, If statements and alot of code was written for this
to be able to happen.
